### Purpose
The overall purpose of this assignment was to perform a short study of the life in a freshwater habitat - first in the field, thence in the laboratory - to see which organisms were present in the study area, what said organisms were like, and what relationships they had with each other.

### Location
The wetlands where the assignment were performed are located on land owned by the Margaret River Senior High School, at
[latitude:-33.958436&deg; longitude:115.070887&deg;](http://www.nearmap.com/?q=@-33.958432,115.070962&ll=-33.958432,115.070962&z=18&t=h&nmd=201009230).

### How was it done
On the day of the "expedition", the whole class trooped down to the farm to grab some water-proof footwear (read: wellies), and proceeded to make their way to the wetlands actual. Once there, everyone grouped/paired off and conducted their respective duties.
