### Purpose
One thing that must be considered *before* any destruction is caused to an environment, if we wish to preserve the native flora and fauna, is ensure that an extensive environmental assessment is made of the area. Such assessments include noting down the various statistics for the area, such as terrestrial soil pH levels, ... etc, etc

### Location
The wetlands where the research was performed are located on land owned by the Margaret River Senior High School, at
[latitude:-33.958436&deg; longitude:115.070887&deg;](http://www.nearmap.com/?q=@-33.958432,115.070962&ll=-33.958432,115.070962&z=18&t=h&nmd=201009230).


### What was done
The following was sampled from the area;
* water samples from both the input and output streams
* plant samples from plants in the area
* soil samples from both above and below water level :)
