### Purpose
The overall purpose of this assignment was to perform a short study of the life in a freshwater habitat - first in the field, thence in the laboratory - to see which organisms were present in the study area, the characteristics of said organisms, and what relationships they had with each other. <!-- This is bullshit; giving us homework while you want us to simultaneously be on top of this damn assignment. However much it may have been repeated beforehand, think before you do. Please -->

### Location
The wetlands where the assignment were performed are located on land owned by the Margaret River Senior High School, at
[latitude:-33.958436&deg; longitude:115.070887&deg;](http://www.nearmap.com/?q=@-33.958432,115.070962&ll=-33.958432,115.070962&z=18&t=h&nmd=201009230).

### How was it done
On the day of the "expedition", the whole class trooped down to the farm to grab some water-proof footwear (read:  wellies), and proceeded to make their way to the wetlands actual. Once there, everyone grouped/paired off and conducted their respective duties. Me and my good friend Matthew grabbed a pile of re-sealable bags and began to collect plant samples, whilst simultaneously writing down their original location. <!-- What else do you want me to write? I don't know what to write, i never know what to write! That is my reply whenever someone asks me why i can't finish an essay; the truthful one, that is. -->Other people completed their own appropriate activities, all of which are listed below :)
